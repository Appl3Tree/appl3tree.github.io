# Security Blue Team BTL1 Course & Certification Review

## Overview
Security Blue Team’s Blue Team Level 1 (BTL1) course and certification is designed as an entry-level program for aspiring defenders, SOC analysts, and incident responders. It provides a structured path across multiple domains of defensive security, introducing both conceptual knowledge and practical workflows that are directly relevant to blue team operations.  

I approached this certification to both validate and expand my existing background in defensive security. My goal was to complete the entire course in full before attempting the exam, ensuring that I understood both the content and the expectations of the exam environment.  

*Snapshot disclaimer: This review is based on the course/exam as of August 2025; content may have changed since writing.*

## Course Overview
The BTL1 course is self-paced and online, organized into **8 domains**. The platform delivers structured learning with **315 topics, 32 quizzes, and 24 labs**, along with approximately **100 hours of lab access time**. Officially, the course is estimated at 30–50 hours to complete, though the actual timeline depends on prior experience and study habits.  

I chose to complete **all 315 topics, all 24 labs, and all 32 quizzes** before sitting the exam. This approach gave me a comprehensive understanding of the course content and set clear expectations for the exam. I spent **25 days** working through the material, studying about **5–15 hours per week**, and built detailed notes throughout. Those notes became my most valuable resource, both for reinforcing what I had learned and as a quick reference during the exam.  

### Domains Covered
- **Introduction** – Program overview, objectives, and study approach.  
- **Security Fundamentals** – Networking, operating system basics, malware fundamentals, and security concepts.  
- **Phishing Analysis** – Email triage, header and link analysis, and safe methods for reviewing malicious attachments.  
- **Threat Intelligence** – Working with open-source intelligence, contextualizing indicators of compromise, and applying structured analysis frameworks.  
- **Digital Forensics** – Imaging and examining disk artifacts, basic memory analysis, and identifying signs of compromise.  
- **Security Information and Event Monitoring (SIEM)** – Using SIEM platforms to parse logs, identify anomalies, and create meaningful detections.  
- **Incident Response** – The incident response lifecycle, investigative documentation, and structured remediation.  
- **BTL1 Exam Preparation** – Consolidation of prior domains with review material.  

The structure of these domains creates a natural progression from foundational knowledge to practical application, making the transition into the exam format straightforward.

## Exam Overview
The BTL1 exam is a **24-hour practical assessment**. It is **open-book and unproctored**, accessed directly through the same portal as the course labs. Once started, the candidate is provided with multiple investigative tasks that require the application of the skills covered across all eight domains.  

### Exam Structure
- **Length:** 24-hour exam window.  
- **Format:** Scenario-based investigation requiring log analysis, phishing triage, forensic review, and detection writing.  
- **Tools:** The exam requires use of SIEMs, forensic analysis platforms, memory inspection utilities, and network traffic analysis tools.  
- **Scoring:** Passing requires **70%**, while a **90%+ first-attempt score** earns the **Gold Coin**. Passing below that threshold awards the Silver Coin.  
- **Timing:** While 24 hours are available, preparation heavily influences how long the exam takes in practice.  

From my perspective, the exam was not difficult, but I would say that is because of my prior experience and familiarity with the type of content covered. I completed it in about **1.5–2 hours** and scored **90% on my first attempt**, earning the Gold Coin. The exam was challenging enough to feel meaningful but fair in its expectations.

## Strengths
- **Structured progression** – The eight domains build logically from basics to advanced workflows.  
- **Comprehensive coverage** – Completing all 315 topics, 24 labs, and 32 quizzes left me confident in both the material and the exam.  
- **Hands-on labs** – The 100 hours of lab access provide ample opportunity to practice and revisit scenarios.  
- **Practical exam format** – Instead of testing memorization, the exam replicates real-world defensive tasks.  
- **Fair difficulty** – With thorough preparation, the exam is approachable, but it still demands applied knowledge.  
- **Value for cost** – At around $540 (£399), the course offers strong content and a meaningful certification outcome for the investment.  

## Limitations
- **Recognition** – While BTL1 is respected and growing in visibility, it does not yet have the same name recognition as SANS or CompTIA certifications.  
- **Time investment** – Completing the course thoroughly requires a substantial commitment.  
- **Tool specificity** – Some of the platform examples focus on particular tools, which may not reflect every SOC environment.  
- **Exam window pressure** – Even though I finished quickly, the 24-hour structure can feel daunting when first starting.  

## Exam Tips
Based on my own experience, a few strategies proved essential:  
- **Take extensive notes** – This was the most important factor in my success. Having a personal playbook made the exam much smoother.  
- **Work through everything** – Completing all topics, labs, and quizzes ensured there were no surprises in the exam.  
- **Organize your references** – Being open-book only helps if your notes are clear and searchable.  
- **Plan your time** – Even if you finish early, budget for breaks.  

## Comparable Courses and Certifications
