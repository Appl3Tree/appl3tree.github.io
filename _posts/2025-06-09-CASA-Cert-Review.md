## CASA - Certified API Security Analyst

## Overview

The CASA certification, offered by APISec University, tests your ability to assess and respond to API vulnerabilities through scenario-based questions. Rather than focusing on definitions or trivia, the exam challenges you to apply your understanding of the OWASP API Top 10 to real-world situations.

This makes it a great choice for red teamers, blue teamers, and developers alike. Anyone working with APIs will benefit from seeing vulnerabilities through different lenses.

## Exam Format

- **Length:** 100 multiple-choice questions  
- **Time Limit:** 2 hours  
- **Cost:** $125 for the initial attempt, $75 for retakes  
- **Instructor:** Corey Ball  
- **Study Material:** [OWASP API Security Top 10 and Beyond!](https://www.apisecuniversity.com/courses/owasp-api-security-top-10-and-beyond)

While the exam isn’t strictly enforced as open- or closed-book, I approached it with the intent of treating it as closed-book to better reflect real understanding. According to a team member at APISec University, the format is meant to be flexible. Some roles benefit from open-book problem solving, while others, like offensive security interviews, expect you to know the material without looking it up. I ended up scoring **97 out of 100** in just over an hour without needing to reference outside material.

## Preparation

### Recommended Study

The only recommended resource is APISec University's course:

> [OWASP API Security Top 10 and Beyond!](https://www.apisecuniversity.com/courses/owasp-api-security-top-10-and-beyond)

This course is taught by Corey Ball and covers the OWASP API Top 10, which form the foundation of the exam:

- **API1: Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)**  
- **API2: Broken Authentication**  
- **API3: Broken Object Property Level Authorization (BOPLA)**  
- **API4: Unrestricted Resource Consumption**  
- **API5: Broken Function Level Authorization**  
- **API6: Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows**  
- **API7: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**  
- **API8: Security Misconfiguration**  
- **API9: Improper Inventory Management**  
- **API10: Unsafe Consumption of APIs**

The course provides examples that align closely with the exam format, helping you understand how each vulnerability manifests in real-world API scenarios.

## Skills That Helped

- Translating behavioral clues into vulnerability types  
- Discerning subtle differences between similar OWASP categories  
- Understanding API logic flaws, not just classic web bugs  
- Applying offensive and defensive perspectives to API security

## Exam Experience

The test felt straightforward and fair. Most questions were scenario-based, requiring you to think through the implications rather than guess terms. Nothing felt like filler or trick phrasing.

It’s not a hands-on exam, but it still demands real understanding—not just memorization. You’ll do well if you’ve read through the OWASP Top 10 a few times and worked with APIs before.

## Final Thoughts

Whether you're hunting bugs, defending endpoints, or building APIs from scratch, CASA gives you a meaningful benchmark for understanding modern API threats. It’s affordable, practical, and backed by solid instruction.

Highly recommended for:

- **Red teamers** looking to expand their API abuse knowledge  
- **Blue teamers** working to defend against modern API threats  
- **Developers** who want to build more secure APIs by learning how they're attacked

## Pros and Cons

### ✅ Pros
- Scenario-based questions test real understanding, not memorization  
- Well-aligned course that’s short, free, and practical  
- Applicable to red teamers, blue teamers, and developers alike  
- Affordable price for the value it provides  
- Clean, fair exam experience with no trick questions

### ❌ Cons
- No hands-on component for those who prefer practical testing  
- Some OWASP categories feel overlapping if you're unfamiliar  
- Not as widely recognized (yet) as traditional certs like OSCP or eJPT

## Final Score

**🧠 Knowledge Depth:** ★★★★☆  
**💰 Value for Cost:** ★★★★★  
**📚 Study Requirements:** ★★☆☆☆  
**🧪 Real-World Applicability:** ★★★★☆  

**Overall Rating:** **4.5 / 5**
