# L3akCTF 2025 Write-up

**Author:** AppleTree  
**Team:** APISec Avengers  
**Event Dates:** July 11–13, 2025  
**Platform:** [ctf.l3ak.team](https://ctf.l3ak.team/)  
**Duration:** 48 Hours  
**Total Challenges:** 64  
**Categories:** Crypto, Pwn, Rev, Web, Misc, Mobile, Forensics, Hardware/RF, OSINT, Hash Cracking  
**Flag Format:** `L3AK{[ -~]+}`  

---

## TL;DR
I focused primarily on the **OSINT** challenges, which followed a GeoGuessr-style format requiring geographic deduction from images. Due to time constraints, I only contributed a couple hours on July 12 and about 30 minutes on July 13. I completed 6 challenges (5 OSINT, 1 Misc) worth 300 total points.

My teammate **[Jesse Freeman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jfreedev/)** handled two **Web** challenges for another 291 points, bringing our team total to **591 points** and a final ranking of **391st place**.

## Tools & Techniques Used

- Google Maps & Street View  
- [Picarta.ai](https://picarta.ai) (AI-based geolocation)  
- Reverse image search (Google & Bing)  
- Blog/forum references for identifying rare landmarks  
- Cardinal direction screenshots for triangulation  

---

## Lessons Learned

- Picarta is extremely effective for narrowing country-level guesses  
- Mapping out all four cardinal views speeds up alignment and confirmation  
- Geoguessr-style CTFs are limited by lack of Street View in many regions  
- AI + traditional OSINT creates a strong combination for visual recon
