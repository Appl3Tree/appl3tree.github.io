# DownUnderCTF 2025 Write-up

**Author:** AppleTree  
**Team:** APISec Avengers  
**Event Dates:** July 19â€“21, 2025  
**Platform:** [DownUnderCTF 2025](https://2025.duc.tf/)  
**Flag Format:** `DUCTF{.*}`

I participated in DownUnderCTF 2025 and tackled a variety of beginner to medium difficulty challenges across OSINT, Reversing, Misc, and Forensics. This post documents the full process for each challenge I solved â€” including the flag, points, and methodology â€” using tools like NBD mounts, AI prompt interaction, binary decompilation, and metadata forensics.

**Flag:** `DUCTF{wow_you_really_boiled_the_ocean_the_shareholders_thankyou}`

### Description
> Dear AppleTree,

> It's time to really push the envelope and go above and beyond! We've got a new challenge for you. Can you find a way to get into our email server?

### Steps Taken
1. **Initial Analysis**
   - Reviewed the provided C source code.
   - Identified a classic buffer overflow via `gets(password)`.
   - Noted that `username` and `password` are both `char[32]`, with `username` declared after `password` â€” making it possible to overflow into `username`.

2. **Bypass Username Check**
   - Challenge prevents logging in as `admin` directly.
   - But the `logins` array shows that `admin` is a valid user with emoji password `ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³`.

3. **Attack Plan**
   - Input a harmless username like `guest`.
   - Overflow the `password` buffer with:
     - The emoji password (`ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³`, 20 bytes)
     - Padding up to 32 bytes
     - Then overwrite the `username` buffer with `admin\x00`.

4. **Payload Construction**
   - Encoded the emoji in raw UTF-8 bytes:  
     `\xf0\x9f\x87\xa6\xf0\x9f\x87\xa9\xf0\x9f\x87\xb2\xf0\x9f\x87\xae\xf0\x9f\x87\xb3`
   - Added a null byte to terminate for `strcmp`.
   - Final payload:
     ```
     [ 20-byte emoji pw ][ padding to 32 ][ b'admin\x00' ]
     ```

5. **Execution**
   - Connected to the challenge via `nc` to `chal.2025-us.ductf.net 30000`.
   - Sent `guest` as username.
   - Sent overflow payload as password.
   - Successfully bypassed the username check and passed the emoji password.

6. **Result**
   - The program jumped into `open_admin_session()`.
   - A shell was spawned.
   - Retrieved flag: `DUCTF{wow_you_really_boiled_the_ocean_the_shareholders_thankyou}`

## zeus  
**Category:** Reversing  
**Points:** 100  
**Flag:** `DUCTF{b3_w4r3_7h3_g0d5}`

### Description
> Dear AppleTree,
> 
> To Zeus Maimaktes, Zeus who comes when the north wind blows, we offer our praise, we make you welcome!
> 
> Regards,  
> jzt

### Steps Taken
1. Decompiled the binary and found an XOR check against a static hex string.
2. Reversed the XOR using the expected comparison result.
3. Submitted the decoded input to the binary:
   ```bash
   echo -ne '[correct bytes]' | ./zeus
   ```
4. The binary accepted the input and printed the flag.

> US: nc chal.2025-us.ductf.net 30016

### Steps Taken
- Connected again:
  ```bash
  nc chal.2025-us.ductf.net 30016
  sudo nbd-client chal.2025-us.ductf.net 30016 /dev/nbd0 -persist
  ```
- Inspected partitions and mounted it:
  ```bash
  sudo fdisk -l /dev/nbd0
  sudo mount /dev/nbd0p1 /mnt
  ```
- Found a suspicious `.ps1` PowerShell script.
- Decoded the base64 payload and retrieved the embedded flag.
- Cleanly unmounted:
  ```bash
  sudo umount /mnt
  sudo nbd-client -d /dev/nbd0
  ```
