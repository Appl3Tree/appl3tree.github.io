### Preparation Tips

- **Complete Splunk’s free Fundamentals training before starting IR‑200**  
  While the course does not officially require prior SIEM experience, familiarity with SIEM interfaces, queries, and dashboards will set you up for success. Splunk offers a strong progression of free foundational courses, including Fundamentals 1, 2, and 3:  
  [Splunk Fundamentals Training](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/training/splunk-fundamentals.html)

- **Thoroughly complete the IR‑200 Challenge Lab**  
  Treat it as a full mock exam, documenting every step as if writing your OSIR report.

- **Practice with general host forensic analysis tools**  
  Analyze disk images, identify malware artifacts, and write clear, structured findings.

- **Simulate full exam conditions**  
  Allocate an 8-hour block for hands-on practice, then spend the following day writing a complete report to build exam endurance.

- **Develop a structured report template**  
  Include sections for Objectives, Tools Used, Methodology, Findings, Screenshots, and Conclusions to streamline report writing under time constraints.

### Lessons Learned

- Documentation quality is as important as technical accuracy  
- Time management across hands-on and report phases is critical  
- Network analysis and host forensic skills complement each other for effective IR workflows

### Final Ratings

| Category | Rating |
|----------|--------|
| 🧠 Knowledge Depth | ★★★★☆ |
| 🧪 Real-World Applicability | ★★★★★ |
| 💰 Value for Cost | ★★★☆☆ |
| 📚 Study Requirements | ★★★★☆ |

**Exact Numeric Average:** 4.0  
**Overall Score:** 4.2 / 5

**Why this rating is slightly above the average:**  
The overall score of 4.2 is slightly higher than the exact average because OSIR fills a critical gap in blue team certifications. Its combination of rigorous hands-on labs, real-world network and forensic workflows, and structured reporting under OffSec’s respected brand offers value beyond what similar-level courses provide.

---

### Final Thoughts

OffSec’s IR‑200 and OSIR certification fill a notable gap for blue teamers seeking hands-on, realistic incident response training with an emphasis on documentation and structured workflows. While intensive and requiring investment, the certification’s strong industry recognition and rigorous exam make it a valuable addition for anyone pursuing SOC or dedicated IR roles.

Although IR‑200 is significantly shorter (~37 hours) than SOC‑200 (~277 hours), it delivers focused, practical training specifically in incident response workflows and reporting. For those seeking a broad foundation in SOC operations, **SOC‑200 may provide greater overall value for the price**. However, for students wanting targeted incident response training validated by OffSec’s respected certification, IR‑200 remains an excellent choice.
