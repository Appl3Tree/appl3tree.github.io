## gooGOOgaaGAA

**Category:** Rev  
**Points:** 100  
**Difficulty:** Unrated  
**Flag:** `shaktictf{b4byR3v_1s_cut3}`

### Description
> Solve this babyrev challenge first ^-^

### Steps Taken
- Observed `gaga()` XOR function (renamed for manual analysis) with key `"IWANTMOMOS"`
- Re-applied XOR to encrypted list to recover flag

```python
def gaga_decrypt(encrypted, key):
    return ''.join(chr(ord(encrypted[i]) ^ ord(key[i % len(key)])) for i in range(len(encrypted)))

key = "IWANTMOMOS"
encrypted = [':','?',' ','%',' ','$',',','9',')','(','+','c','#','7','\x06','~','9','\x12','~',' ','\x16','4','4',':','g','0']
flag = gaga_decrypt(encrypted, key)
print(flag)  
```

## Hooman

**Category:** Web  
**Points:** 100  
**Difficulty:** Unrated  
**Flag:** `shaktictf{n0on3_l1k3s_5ar4h}`

### Description
> Try your best to prove being a Hooman!
> 
> Author: .\_switch\_

### Steps Taken
1. Review the Source Code

    We are given the Flask app source code `app.py`. Key behaviors:

    - On `/login`, a JWT is generated with `are_you_hooman: False`
    - The JWT is signed with `HS256` and the secret `'Youcanneverhavethis'`
    - The `/hooman` route only allows access if `are_you_hooman: True`
    - When decoding the JWT:
      ```python
      decoded = jwt.decode(token, key=None, options={"verify_signature": False})

2. Forge a JWT
    We can now forge a JWT without knowing the real secret. There are two approaches:

    Use jwt.io directly

    Use Python's jwt.encode (PyJWT) — though some environments block HS256 without a key.

    To make it easy, I used jwt.io via archive.org, since newer versions of the tool enforce recommended requirements.

3. Set the Cookie
    Once we get the JWT token from jwt.io, we set it in our browser’s cookies.
    
    In DevTools (Chrome or Edge):

    1. Go to Application > Cookies
    2. Find the domain
    3. Set a cookie named token to the forged JWT
    
4. Reload the page.

## Brain Games

**Category:** Web  
**Points:** 100  
**Difficulty:** Unrated  
**Flag:** `shaktictf{n0on3_l1k3s_5ar4h}`

### Description
> 🎮🧑‍💻
> 
> Author: .\_switch\_

### Steps Taken
- Inputs like `help` returned MD5 hash → confirmed command injection (though intended?)
- Spaces, `/`, `cat`, `ls` blocked;
- `;`, `dir` allowed
- Enumerated environment and listed files using:
  ```bash
  dir;
  ```
- Used `${IFS}` to bypass space filter
- Found partial flag in `user.txt`; hint pointed to `/usr/local/flag`
  ```bash
  head${IFS}user.txt
  ```
- Used `${HOME:0:1}` to bypass `/` filter
- Read final part of flag:
  ```bash
  head${IFS}${HOME:0:1}usr${HOME:0:1}local${HOME:0:1}flag;
  ```
- Combined flag parts for final flag

## Takeaways

- **Misc & OSINT:** Geolocation from visual cues and hidden messages in Discord are common quick wins
- **Reversing:** Simple XOR and layered rotation/XOR patterns remain CTF staples
- **Web:** JWT signature bypass and blacklist command injection are classic but valuable vulnerabilities to understand
