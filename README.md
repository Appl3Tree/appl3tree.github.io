# HTB Writeups

This gitpage will primarily be used for my HTB/OffSec box write-ups. I may also do some write-ups of certifications, but that's still up in the air.  

My Notes can be found on my [GitBook page](https://appl3tree.gitbook.io/notes) while write-ups will be found on my [GitPage](https://appl3tree.github.io). 

The other goal with doing these write-ups is to ideally work on my note-taking and reporting for an actual engagement.
